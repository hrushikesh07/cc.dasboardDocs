**Command Center**

What is RLCatalyst Command Center
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
RLCatalyst Command Center is a cloud-based software product that can be used to monitor services and their underlying infrastructure. The product provides early detection and warning of problems in the targeted services or infrastructure. The product also provides capabilities to integrate problem tickets and capture incident details which can help to narrow down root cause.

**Planning your deployment**

RLCatalyst Command Center is capable of multi-tenancy. Using the same instance of the software, you can create several tenants. Each tenant can configure his own machines for monitoring. Each tenant can also configure his own cloud accounts and get an independent view of his cloud assets.

**Creating your first tenant**

To plan the creation of a new tenant, use the planning sheet in Appendix A to collect all the information required upfront. Keep the sheet handy as you go through the following steps.
